# HTML-Music-Player
#### I looked everywhere on GitHub for a music player in HTML. Couldn't find one, so I made one!
#### You can upload any audio file to this website and it will play it.

## Features
#### Queue - You can add, remove, and play songs from the queue.
#### Autoplay - When the current song ends, and if there is another song in the queue, it will be played.
#### Shuffle - The shuffle button shuffles the queue (AMAZING!!!1!)
#### Coverart Loader - The music player will load the coverart for the current song if it is in the files metadata.
#### `file://` Compatibility - This can load in the file:// protocol, great for school chromebooks (because the built in one sucks).
